--- Original Description ---
Adds bullet casings, which fly out of weapons when fired (visuals!).

While this mod does not add ammo, it does add the appearance of ammo being used by throwing empty casings out of weapons when they are fired. Default casings are assault rifle casings, there is shotgun and charge weapon variants, the latter of which are meant to be slightly humorous.

Settings:
Filth - enable or disable bullet casing filth, leftover bullet casings that pawns have to sweep up.

You can turn rotation on/off - this makes the casings fly always at the same angle if off, otherwise it depends on the rotation of the weapon. Just like the mod that's purely visual, choose what you prefer.

Velocity Factor - you can set a range from which a random number gets chose, that number is the speed of the casing. High values will look weird. Again, choose what you like.</description>
